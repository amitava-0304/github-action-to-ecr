# Phishing Domain Detection 💳


## 🪄 About

This is an End-to-End Machine Learning project with deployment. The project aims at developing a model and predict whether the domain is real or fake..

The project was created using Python Flask and deployed in Azure App services.

## 🏋🏻‍♂️ Motivation

Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.
The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.


## 📈 DataSource

Phishing Websites Dataset
Published: 24 September 2020 | Version 1 | DOI:10.17632/72ptz43s9v.1 | Contributor:Grega Vrbančič
# Description
These data consist of a collection of legitimate as well as phishing website instances. Each website is represented by the set of features which denote, whether website is legitimate or not. Data can serve as an input for machine learning process.

In this repository the two variants of the Phishing Dataset are presented.

## Full variant - dataset_full.csv
Short description of the full variant dataset:
Total number of instances: 88,647
Number of legitimate website instances (labeled as 0): 58,000
Number of phishing website instances (labeled as 1): 30,647
Total number of features: 111

## Small variant - dataset_small.csv
Short description of the small variant dataset:
Total number of instances: 58,645
Number of legitimate website instances (labeled as 0): 27,998
Number of phishing website instances (labeled as 1): 30,647
Total number of features: 111
